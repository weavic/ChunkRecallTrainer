"""
Authentication module for the Chunk Recall Trainer application.

This module handles user authentication using Firebase via the streamlit-firebase-auth
library. It provides functions to initialize the authentication service,
manage the login/session check process, and render a logout button.
User access can be restricted based on an allowed list of email addresses
defined in the application configuration.

    Manages user authentication, including session checking and login form display.

    This function checks for an active session. If found, it validates the user's
