      # Other environment variables from .env will also be loaded here.
      # Example: OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      # Ensure critical runtime env vars needed by the app itself are also listed
      # if they are not exclusively in the .env file or need to be explicitly passed.
      # For PYTHONPATH, direct definition is usually best.
      # If .env file already defines PYTHONPATH, this will override it.
      # If .env defines other critical vars like OPENAI_API_KEY, they are loaded by env_file.
      # Adding them explicitly under 'environment' can also work and sometimes offers more clarity or control.
      # For this task, only PYTHONPATH is the explicit requirement.
