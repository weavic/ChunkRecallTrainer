# Chunk Recall Trainer

> **Status:** âœ¨ Prototype (Sprint 1: 2025-04-## â†’ 04-##)

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement

Intermediate English learners often *recognise* useful sentence chunks but cannot *recall* them fast enough in real conversations.  
**Chunk Recall Trainer** lets learners log those chunks, then surfaces exactly five that are about to be forgotten, using a spaced-repetition algorithm. Timely recall practice turns passive knowledge into fluent, automatic output.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

1. **Record** & tag chunks you want to retain (manual form or Google Sheets import).  
2. **Review** with a 5-item quiz driven by the SM-2 algorithm (Hard / Good / Easy buttons).  
3. **Output prompts** for speaking or writing, including optional Whisper speech input.  
4. **Progress tracking**: review streak, Ease-Factor graph, next due counts.  
5. *(Planned)* **Variations generator**: GPT-4o paraphrases each chunk for flexibility.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- **Daily output training** with your personal phrase bank (â‰ˆ 3 min/day).  
- **Shadowing / repeating** support: auto-queue yesterdayâ€™s shadowing script.  
- **TOEIC / IELTS speaking prep** with a structure-first approach.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Roadmap

- [ ] Streamlit UI  
- [ ] SQLite data layer (Google Sheets sync v0.2)  
- [ ] SM-2 scheduling service (pure Python)  
- [ ] LangChain templating for GPT-powered prompts  
- [ ] Whisper speech-to-text integration (v0.3)  

## âš¡ Quick Start (coming in v0.1)
